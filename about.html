<!-- My Story -->

    <h2><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> My Story</h2>
    <div class="about-story">
        <p>
            My journey in AI began during my M.Tech in Data Science at <strong>IIT Jammu</strong>,
            where I developed a deep fascination for how machines can understand and generate human language.
            What started as academic curiosity evolved into a career dedicated to making AI systems that
            are not just powerful, but also trustworthy and practical.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my time at <strong>nference.ai</strong>, I transitioned from pure research to building
            production healthcare systems. I explored everything from CLIP for chest X-rays to large language
            models for clinical information extraction. This experience taught me that the real challenge
            isn't just achieving high accuracy in research papers, it's about deploying reliable systems that
            healthcare professionals can trust with patient care.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, I work as an Independent AI Consultant leading end-to-end design and deployment
            of Generative AI, LLM, and multimodal RAG systems for global enterprise clients across manufacturing, healthcare, 
            and technology domains. Every day, I work on problems that require not just technical expertise, but also 
            deep understanding of user needs and real-world constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond my day job, I'm passionate about knowledge sharing. Through my blog
            <strong>Token by Token</strong>, I write about AI, ML, LLMs, RAG systems, and the practical challenges
            of building GenAI applications. I believe in learning in public and helping others navigate
            the rapidly evolving AI landscape.
